Rear Seatbelt Legislation and Road Safety Analysis
Introduction
This project is focused on analyzing the impact of rear seatbelt legislation in various countries on road safety outcomes. The goal is to assess how implementing mandatory rear seatbelt laws has affected road accident statistics, including injury and fatality rates. We also explore the effectiveness of different enforcement mechanisms and penalties, offering insights into the success of these laws in promoting public safety.

Project Structure
The project is structured around the following tasks:

Data Collection & Research:

Collected information about five countries that have implemented rear seatbelt laws.
Researched fines, non-monetary penalties, and enforcement methods in these countries.
Collected data on road accident statistics (fatalities and injuries) before and after the legislation was enacted.
Data Analysis:

Analyzed the effectiveness of rear seatbelt laws using collected data.
Compared the trends of accident statistics (fatalities, injuries) before and after legislation across multiple countries.
Assessed the role of public awareness and government enforcement techniques.
Visualization:

Created charts to visualize the trends in fatalities and injury rates before and after legislation.
Bar charts to compare fines and penalties across countries.
Line charts to display trends in accident statistics.
Impact Analysis:

Evaluated the reduction in fatalities and injuries post-legislation.
Identified trends in the effectiveness of enforcement techniques such as fines, camera monitoring, and non-monetary penalties.
Provided recommendations for countries that do not have mandatory rear seatbelt laws, based on the observed success of these laws in other countries.
Presentation:

Created a visual presentation summarizing the findings.
Included key charts and tables to support the analysis.
Provided a brief written report with methodology and takeaways.
Data & Methodology
1. Data Sources:
Road safety reports from government websites.
World Health Organization (WHO) and other reliable international road safety organizations.
National traffic law databases and official enforcement records.
Academic research on the impact of rear seatbelt legislation.
2. Countries Selected:
Portugal (Legislation: 2009)
France (Legislation: 2010)
Spain (Legislation: 2014)
Germany (Comparison Data)
Netherlands (Comparison Data)
3. Data Fields:
Monetary Fines: Fine amounts for front and rear seatbelt violations.
Non-Monetary Penalties: Points on driverâ€™s license or other forms of punishment.
Fatality and Injury Rates: Collected data on accident statistics before and after the legislation was passed.
4. Analysis Tools:
Python (for data analysis and visualization)
Libraries used: pandas, matplotlib, numpy
Data visualization using bar charts and line charts to display changes in road safety statistics.
5. Key Findings:
A consistent reduction in injury and fatality rates post-legislation.
Public awareness campaigns and stricter enforcement contributed significantly to road safety improvements.
The size of the monetary fine and non-monetary penalties (such as points on a license) appeared to correlate with higher compliance rates.
How to Run the Project
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Install the required libraries:
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
Running the Analysis:
Clone the repository or download the files.
Run the Python scripts to perform data analysis and generate visualizations.
Main analysis script: rear_seatbelt_analysis.py
Visualization script: visualization.py
Output:
The analysis will produce:
Bar charts comparing seatbelt fines and penalties across selected countries.
Line charts showing trends in road safety statistics (fatalities and injuries) before and after the legislation.
Recommendations
Based on the analysis, countries that do not currently have mandatory rear seatbelt laws should adopt similar legislation. Countries with existing laws could enhance enforcement by increasing fines or introducing camera-based monitoring systems. Public awareness campaigns also play a crucial role in improving compliance and should be part of the legislative rollout.
