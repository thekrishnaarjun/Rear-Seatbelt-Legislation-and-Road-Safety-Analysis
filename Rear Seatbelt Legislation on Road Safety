Slide 2: Introduction
Objective: Analyze the impact of rear seatbelt legislation on road safety, focusing on reduction in fatalities and injuries.
Countries Analyzed: Portugal, France, Spain, Germany, Netherlands
Methodology Overview: Data collection, comparison of accident statistics, and assessment of enforcement methods.

Slide 3: Research Methodology
Data Sources:
Government traffic reports
World Health Organization (WHO)
Research papers
Metrics Analyzed:
Fatality rates before and after legislation
Fines and penalties for non-compliance
Enforcement mechanisms (camera systems, police checks)

Slide 4: Key Legislation Details (Table)
Title: "Overview of Rear Seatbelt Legislation"
Add a table summarizing:
Country | Year of Legislation | Description
Portugal | 2009 | Mandatory use of rear seat belts, fines, awareness campaigns.
France | 2010 | Included rear seat belts in existing law, penalties for non-compliance.
Spain | 2014 | Stricter enforcement of rear seat belt law, increased penalties.


Slide 5: Fatality & Injury Rate Trends (Visualization)
Title: "Impact of Rear Seatbelt Laws on Road Safety"
Add a line chart comparing fatalities and injuries before and after legislation for each country.
X-axis: Year
Y-axis: Fatalities/Injuries
Countries: Portugal, France, Spain, etc.
Key Insight: Show how the implementation of legislation correlates with a decline in fatalities and injuries.

Slide 6: Compliance and Penalties
Title: "Monetary and Non-Monetary Penalties"
Bar Chart comparing:
Front seatbelt fines vs. rear seatbelt fines for each country.
List non-monetary penalties (e.g., points on license, license suspension).
Insight: Countries with higher fines and stricter penalties tend to see better compliance and fewer fatalities.

Slide 7: Public Awareness Campaigns
Title: "Role of Public Awareness in Compliance"
Add images/graphics to demonstrate public awareness efforts (campaign posters, road signs).
Key Insight: Awareness campaigns played a crucial role in educating the public about the new legislation.

Slide 8: Comparative Analysis
Title: "Comparative Analysis Across Countries"
Table:
Compare enforcement methods (e.g., frequency of checks, camera systems).
Country | Enforcement Method | Compliance Rate | Fatality Reduction (%)



Slide 9: Key Findings
Title: "Summary of Findings"
Portugal: Fatalities reduced by X%, consistent police checks.
France: Decrease in fatalities, strong public campaigns.
Spain: High fines, significant reduction in injuries.
Germany: Early adopter of laws, lower injury rates sustained over time.
Netherlands: Long-term compliance, sustained reduction in accidents.

Slide 10: Recommendations
Title: "Recommendations for Countries Without Rear Seatbelt Laws"
Implement rear seatbelt legislation with a combination of fines and non-monetary penalties.
Increase public awareness campaigns to boost compliance.
Use technology (e.g., camera-based monitoring) to enforce the laws effectively.

Slide 11: Suggested Improvements
Title: "Suggested Improvements to Existing Laws"
Stricter enforcement with frequent police checks.
Introduction of progressive fines for repeated offenses.
Integrate seatbelt use as part of driver training programs.

Slide 12: Conclusion
Summary: Rear seatbelt legislation has had a significant positive impact on reducing road fatalities and injuries.
Call to Action: Governments without such laws should implement them to enhance road safety.










Python Code for Charts:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample data
countries = ['Portugal', 'France', 'Spain', 'Germany', 'Netherlands']
fatalities_before = [150, 180, 140, 160, 90]
fatalities_after = [130, 150, 120, 140, 75]

# Create a bar chart to compare fatalities before and after legislation
x = np.arange(len(countries))
width = 0.35

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
rects1 = ax.bar(x - width/2, fatalities_before, width, label='Before Legislation')
rects2 = ax.bar(x + width/2, fatalities_after, width, label='After Legislation')

# Add labels and title
ax.set_ylabel('Fatalities')
ax.set_title('Fatalities Before and After Seatbelt Legislation')
ax.set_xticks(x)
ax.set_xticklabels(countries)
ax.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('fatalities_comparison.png')  # Save the chart as an image for the presentation
plt.show()
